# extractbdays
A hacky, messy - but stable - tool written to easily extract animal crossing birthdays from the wiki and add them to a Google Calendar.

This was used to create the birthdays part of [my Animal Crossing Calendar](https://github.com/zedseven/ac-calendar).

This is mostly uploaded as an example implementation of the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/) and [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/) in Go, though it certainly isn't the cleanest.
